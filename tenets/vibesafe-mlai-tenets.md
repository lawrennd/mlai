# MLAI Project Tenets

## 1. Clarity Over Cleverness
Code should be easy to read and understand, especially for those new to machine learning or Python. Avoid unnecessary abstraction or “clever” tricks that obscure the underlying mathematics or logic.

## 2. Mathematical Transparency
Mathematical concepts should be explicit in both code and documentation. Variable names, function names, and comments should reflect standard mathematical notation where possible. Include mathematical equations in docstrings or comments to bridge code and theory.

## 3. Educational Focus
Every module, function, and class should serve a clear pedagogical purpose. Provide examples and explanations that help users learn, not just use, the code. Prefer simple, illustrative implementations over highly optimized or production-grade code.

## 4. Good Python Practices
Follow PEP 8 and PEP 257 for code and docstring style. Use type hints and modern Python features where they improve clarity. Write modular, testable code with clear separation of concerns.

## 5. Reproducibility
Ensure that all examples and tutorials can be run end-to-end by users. Use fixed random seeds where appropriate for consistent results.

## 6. Inclusivity and Accessibility
Documentation and code should be accessible to a diverse audience, including those with limited prior experience. Avoid jargon and explain terms when first introduced.

## 7. Open Science and Sharing
Prefer open-source tools and datasets. Encourage contributions and sharing of improvements, examples, and teaching materials.
