Utilities Module

This module contains utility functions including:
- Optimization utilities (finite_difference_gradient, finite_difference_jacobian, verify_gradient_implementation)
- Data generation utilities (load_pgm, generate_swiss_roll)
- Mathematical utilities (radial_multivariate, dist2)
- Plotting utilities (write_figure_caption)
