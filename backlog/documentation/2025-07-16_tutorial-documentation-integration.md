# Task: Ensure Tutorials are Shared in Documentation and Integration with Tests is Documented


## Description
The MLAI project has comprehensive integration tests for tutorial workflows, but the documentation needs to be updated to reflect these tests and ensure that tutorials are properly shared and documented. This task involves:

1. **Documentation Updates**: Update the main documentation to include information about the tutorial integration tests
2. **Tutorial Sharing**: Ensure that tutorial examples are properly shared in the documentation
3. **Test Documentation**: Document how the integration tests work and what they verify
4. **User Guide**: Create a user guide that explains how to run tutorials and verify they work

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Documentation includes section on tutorial integration tests
- [ ] Tutorial examples are properly shared in documentation
- [ ] Test documentation explains what each integration test verifies
- [ ] User guide includes instructions for running tutorials
- [ ] Documentation links to relevant test files
- [ ] Tutorial workflow examples are documented with expected outputs

## Implementation Notes
- Focus on the integration tests in `tests/integration/test_tutorial_workflows.py`
- Document the workflow script tests in `tests/integration/test_workflow_script.py`
- Include examples of expected outputs and metrics
- Explain how the tests ensure tutorial reliability
- Consider adding screenshots or example plots from successful test runs
