# Task: Build Comprehensive Tests for plot.py


## Description
The `plot.py` module currently has very low test coverage (8%) and needs comprehensive testing to ensure reliability and maintainability. This module contains critical plotting functionality used throughout the MLAI tutorials and examples.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Unit tests for all major plotting functions
- [ ] Integration tests for plot generation workflows
- [ ] Tests for plot file output and saving
- [ ] Tests for plot customization options
- [ ] Tests for error handling and edge cases
- [ ] Mock tests for matplotlib dependencies
- [ ] Coverage target: >80% for plot.py
- [ ] Documentation of test patterns for plotting code

## Implementation Notes
- Use matplotlib testing utilities for plot verification
- Mock matplotlib backend to avoid display issues in CI
- Test both interactive and non-interactive plotting modes
- Focus on testing plot generation logic rather than visual appearance
- Use pytest fixtures for common plot data and configurations
- Consider using pytest-mpl for image comparison tests
- Test plot file output using temporary directories

## Current State
- plot.py has 1906 statements with only 8% coverage
- Most plotting functions are untested
- No integration tests for plot workflows
- Limited error handling tests

- CIP: 0002 (Comprehensive Test Framework)
- Current Coverage: 8% (1906 statements, 1752 missed)
- Target Coverage: >80%
