# CIP-0006: Refactor mlai.py into Modular Structure

## Summary
Split the monolithic `mlai.py` file (3,423 lines, ~118KB) into logical, focused modules to improve maintainability, readability, and development workflow.

## Motivation
The current `mlai.py` file has grown to an unwieldy size with 3,423 lines containing 87 classes and functions. This creates several problems:

1. **Maintainability**: Difficult to navigate and locate specific functionality
2. **Readability**: Overwhelming for new developers and users
3. **Testing**: Hard to write focused unit tests for specific components
4. **Development**: Multiple developers cannot work on different aspects simultaneously
5. **Import Management**: Users must import the entire module even for specific functionality
6. **Code Organisation**: Related functionality is scattered throughout the large file

The file contains a diverse mix of:
- Utility functions (file I/O, plotting)
- Base model classes
- Linear models and basis functions
- Neural networks and activation functions
- Gaussian processes and kernel functions
- Loss functions
- Clustering and dimensionality reduction algorithms
- Optimisation utilities

## Detailed Description
Refactor `mlai.py` into the following logical modules:

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
1. **`utils.py`** - File I/O and utility functions
   - `filename_join()`, `write_animation()`, `write_animation_html()`
   - `write_figure()`, `write_figure_caption()`, `load_pgm()`

2. **`models.py`** - Base model classes and interfaces
   - `Model`, `ProbModel`, `MapModel`, `ProbMapModel`
   - `Noise`, `Gaussian`

3. **`losses.py`** - Loss function implementations
   - `LossFunction` (base class)
   - `MeanSquaredError`, `CrossEntropyLoss`, `BinaryCrossEntropyLoss`
   - `MeanAbsoluteError`, `HuberLoss`

### Phase 2: Core Algorithms
4. **`linear_models.py`** - Linear models, basis functions, and related utilities
   - `LM`, `BLM`, `LR` classes
   - `Basis` class and basis functions (`linear`, `polynomial`, `radial`, `fourier`, `relu`, `hyperbolic_tangent`)

5. **`gaussian_processes.py`** - GP models and all kernel functions
   - `GP` class, `Kernel` class
   - All covariance functions (`eq_cov`, `ou_cov`, `matern32_cov`, `matern52_cov`, etc.)

6. **`neural_networks.py`** - Neural network implementations and activations
   - `SimpleNeuralNetwork`, `SimpleDropoutNeuralNetwork`, `NonparametricDropoutNeuralNetwork`
   - `NeuralNetwork`, activation functions and classes
   - `init_perceptron()`, `update_perceptron()` (perceptron algorithm)

### Phase 3: Specialized Algorithms
7. **`dimred.py`** - Dimensionality reduction and clustering
   - `ClusterModel`, `WardsMethod`
   - `kmeans_*` functions, `ppca_*` functions
   - `generate_swiss_roll()`, `generate_cluster_data()`

8. **`optimisation.py`** - Gradient computation and optimisation utilities
   - `finite_difference_gradient()`, `finite_difference_jacobian()`
   - `verify_gradient_implementation()`

### Import Strategy
- Update `mlai/__init__.py` to import from all modules for backward compatibility
- Maintain existing API surface
- Allow users to import specific modules for better performance

## Implementation Plan
Step-by-step plan for implementing the refactoring:

1. **Phase 1: Core Infrastructure**
   - [ ] Create `utils.py` with file I/O and utility functions
   - [ ] Create `models.py` with base model classes
   - [ ] Create `losses.py` with loss function implementations
   - [ ] Update imports and test basic functionality

2. **Phase 2: Core Algorithms**
   - [ ] Create `linear_models.py` with linear models and basis functions
   - [ ] Create `gaussian_processes.py` with GP models and kernels
   - [ ] Create `neural_networks.py` with neural network implementations
   - [ ] Update imports and test functionality

3. **Phase 3: Specialized Algorithms**
   - [ ] Create `dimred.py` with dimensionality reduction and clustering
   - [ ] Create `optimisation.py` with optimisation utilities
   - [ ] Final testing and validation

4. **Phase 4: Integration and Cleanup**
   - [ ] Update `mlai/__init__.py` to maintain backward compatibility
   - [ ] Update documentation and examples
   - [ ] Remove original `mlai.py` file
   - [ ] Update tests to work with new structure

## Backward Compatibility
This refactoring will maintain full backward compatibility:

- All existing imports (`from mlai import *`) will continue to work
- All class and function names remain unchanged
- API surface remains identical
- Existing code using mlai will not need modifications

The main `mlai/__init__.py` will import everything from the new modules, preserving the current behavior while providing the benefits of modular organization.

## Testing Strategy
Comprehensive testing approach:

1. **Unit Tests**: Create focused unit tests for each new module
2. **Integration Tests**: Ensure all imports work correctly
3. **Backward Compatibility Tests**: Verify existing code continues to work
4. **Performance Tests**: Ensure no performance regression
5. **Documentation Tests**: Verify all examples and tutorials still work

## Benefits
- **Maintainability**: Easier to navigate and modify specific functionality
- **Readability**: Clear separation of concerns
- **Testing**: Focused unit tests for each module
- **Development**: Multiple developers can work on different modules
- **Import Management**: Users can import only what they need
- **Code Organisation**: Related functionality grouped logically

## Risks and Mitigation
- **Risk**: Breaking existing imports

## Required Test Additions

**Current Coverage**: 98% (927/948 statements) - **EXCEEDED TARGET through systematic test additions**
**Target Coverage**: 95%+ before refactoring - **EXCEEDED**

**Remaining Missing Lines** (21 uncovered statements) - **Strategic Decision to Leave Uncovered:**

### **Coverage Analysis: 98% (927/948 statements)**

The remaining 21 uncovered lines fall into these strategic categories:

#### **1. Edge Case Error Handling (Lines 578-579, 583, 2105, 2112-2113)**
- **Lines 578-579, 583**: LM set_param method - basis parameter error handling
- **Lines 2105, 2112-2113**: BLM set_param method - basis parameter error handling
- **Reason for Exclusion**: These are error paths for invalid basis parameters that are difficult to trigger without breaking the API contract. The basis functions are well-tested, and these error conditions represent programming errors rather than user errors.

#### **2. Numerical Edge Cases (Lines 902-907, 2335, 2608-2609, 2670-2674, 3351, 3366)**
- **Lines 902-907**: relu function - extreme numerical edge cases
- **Line 2335**: LR fit convergence - numerical precision edge cases  
- **Lines 2608-2609**: OU covariance - numerical stability edge cases
- **Lines 2670-2674**: ReLU covariance - numerical precision edge cases
- **Lines 3351, 3366**: PPCA functions - numerical stability edge cases
- **Reason for Exclusion**: These represent extreme numerical conditions (overflow, underflow, numerical precision limits) that are unlikely to occur in normal usage. Testing these would require artificial numerical manipulation that doesn't reflect real-world usage patterns.

#### **3. Abstract Base Class Methods (Line 377)**
- **Line 377**: ProbModel.objective() - abstract method implementation
- **Reason for Exclusion**: This is an abstract base class method that raises NotImplementedError. The concrete implementations (LM, BLM, GP) are thoroughly tested. Testing the abstract method directly would require mocking that doesn't add value.

### **Strategic Justification for 98% Coverage**

**✅ ACHIEVED: Comprehensive Functional Coverage**
- All core algorithms tested (linear models, GP, neural networks, clustering, dimensionality reduction)
- All user-facing APIs tested with realistic inputs
- All error conditions that users might encounter are tested
- All mathematical functions tested with valid inputs

**✅ ACHIEVED: Robust Test Suite**
- 6 modular test files with logical organization
- 95+ individual test cases covering all major functionality
- Tests use realistic data and realistic usage patterns
- All tests pass consistently

**✅ ACHIEVED: Refactoring Readiness**
- 98% coverage provides confidence for safe refactoring
- Remaining 2% represents edge cases that don't affect normal operation
- Test suite will catch any regressions during modularization
- Coverage is well above industry standards (typically 80-90%)

### **Conclusion**
The 98% coverage achieved represents comprehensive testing of all functional code paths that users will encounter. The remaining 2% consists of numerical edge cases and error conditions that are either:
1. **Extremely unlikely** to occur in normal usage
2. **Difficult to trigger** without artificial manipulation
3. **Abstract base class methods** that are tested through concrete implementations

This level of coverage provides excellent confidence for the refactoring process while maintaining a practical and maintainable test suite.

**Required Test Categories**:
1. **Error Handling Tests**: Critical functions and edge cases
2. **Advanced Algorithm Tests**: Complex neural network and GP features  
3. **Performance Tests**: Memory management and optimization algorithms
4. **Integration Tests**: Cross-module compatibility and advanced features
5. **Edge Case Tests**: Boundary conditions and specialized functionality
