# CIP-0001: Documentation Improvements with Sphinx

## Summary
This CIP proposes comprehensive documentation improvements for the MLAI package, including setting up Sphinx documentation generation, enhancing the README.md, and creating proper API documentation for all modules.

## Motivation
The current documentation is minimal and insufficient for users and contributors. The README.md contains only a single sentence, and there's no structured documentation system in place. This makes it difficult for:

- New users to understand how to use the MLAI package
- Contributors to understand the codebase structure
- Educators to find relevant teaching materials
- Developers to maintain and extend the codebase

A proper documentation system with Sphinx will provide:
- Auto-generated API documentation
- Structured tutorials and guides
- Better discoverability of features
- Professional presentation for educational use

## Detailed Description

### Current State Analysis
- README.md contains only a single sentence description
- No API documentation exists
- No installation or usage instructions
- No examples or tutorials
- No contribution guidelines

### Proposed Improvements

#### 1. Enhanced README.md
- Comprehensive project description
- Installation instructions
- Quick start guide with examples
- Project structure overview
- Contributing guidelines
- License information
- Links to documentation

#### 2. Sphinx Documentation Setup
- Configure Sphinx for Python documentation
- Set up automatic API documentation generation
- Create documentation structure with:
  - User guide
  - API reference
  - Tutorials
  - Installation guide
  - Contributing guide

#### 3. Module Documentation
- Add docstrings to all Python modules
- Create tutorials for each major feature
- Document the teaching/lecturing aspects
- Include mathematical explanations where relevant

#### 4. Documentation Hosting
- Set up Read the Docs integration
- Configure automatic documentation builds
- Ensure documentation is accessible online

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)
1. *Set up Sphinx environment*:
   - Install Sphinx and required extensions
   - Create `docs/` directory structure
   - Configure `conf.py` for MLAI project
   - Set up basic documentation theme

2. *Enhance README.md*:
   - Write comprehensive project description
   - Add installation instructions
   - Include quick start examples
   - Add project structure overview

### Phase 2: Core Documentation
3. *Create documentation structure*:
   - User guide with tutorials
   - API reference documentation
   - Installation and setup guide
   - Contributing guidelines

4. *Add module docstrings*:
   - Document all public functions and classes
   - Add type hints where missing
   - Include usage examples in docstrings

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
5. *Set up automatic documentation*:
   - Configure GitHub Actions for doc builds
   - Set up Read the Docs integration
   - Add documentation badges to README

6. *Create tutorials*:
   - Machine learning tutorial using MLAI
   - Gaussian Process tutorial
   - Deep GP tutorial
   - Mountain Car example tutorial

### Phase 4: Polish and Launch
7. *Final review and testing*:
   - Test all documentation links
   - Verify code examples work
   - Review for clarity and completeness

8. *Launch and announce*:
   - Deploy to Read the Docs
   - Update all references to documentation
   - Announce to users and contributors

## Backward Compatibility
This change is purely additive and will not affect any existing functionality. All existing code will continue to work as before. The only changes are:
- Enhanced README.md (replaces existing minimal version)
- Addition of documentation files and directories
- Addition of documentation dependencies

## Testing Strategy
- Verify all code examples in documentation run successfully
- Test documentation builds locally and on CI
- Validate all internal links work correctly
- Test Read the Docs integration
- Review documentation with potential users

## Related Requirements
This CIP addresses the following requirements:

- [VibeSafe tenets/](tenets/) - Professional documentation standards
- [Backlog tasks](backlog/) - Documentation improvement tasks

Specifically, it implements solutions for:
- Professional project presentation
- User onboarding and education
- Contributor enablement
- Educational material organization
