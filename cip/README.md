# Code Improvement Proposals (CIPs)

## Overview

Code Improvement Proposals (CIPs) are documents that describe proposed changes to the referia codebase. They serve as a way to document design decisions, track progress on implementation, and provide context for code changes.

## Process

1. **Create a New CIP**:
   - Copy the `cip_template.md` file
   - Name it `cipXXXX.md` where XXXX is the next number in sequence
   - Fill in the details of your proposal

2. **Review**:
   - Share the CIP with other developers for feedback
   - Update the CIP based on feedback

3. **Implementation**:
   - Update the CIP with implementation details
   - Mark tasks as complete in the Implementation Status section as you make progress

4. **Completion**:
   - Once all tasks are complete, mark the CIP as completed
   - Add a summary of the changes made

## CIP Status

Each CIP can have one of the following statuses:

- **Draft**: Initial proposal, subject to change
- **Accepted**: Proposal has been accepted and is ready for implementation
- **In Progress**: Implementation is underway
- **Completed**: Implementation is complete
- **Rejected**: Proposal has been rejected

## Creating a Good CIP

A good CIP should:

1. Clearly state the problem being solved
2. Explain the proposed solution in detail
3. Consider alternative approaches
4. Address backward compatibility
5. Include a testing strategy
6. Provide a clear implementation plan
7. Consider potential drawbacks or risks
