# CIP-0007: Implement Unified Optimization Interface and Algorithms

## Summary
Implement a unified optimization interface for all models (linear models, neural networks, Gaussian processes) and create a comprehensive optimization module with modern algorithms like SGD, Adam, and others.

## Motivation
Currently, different model types have inconsistent optimization interfaces:
- **Linear models**: Have `parameters` and `gradients` properties (just implemented)
- **Neural networks**: Have `parameters` property but no `gradients` property
- **Gaussian processes**: No unified optimization interface
- **No centralized optimization algorithms**: Each model implements its own training logic

This creates several problems:
1. **Inconsistent interfaces**: Different models require different optimization approaches
2. **Code duplication**: Each model reimplements optimization logic
3. **Limited algorithms**: Only basic gradient descent available
4. **No unified training**: Cannot use the same optimizer across different model types
5. **Poor extensibility**: Adding new optimization algorithms requires modifying each model

## Detailed Description

### Phase 1: Complete the Unified Interface
1. **Add `gradients` property to neural networks**
   - `SimpleNeuralNetwork`, `NeuralNetwork`, `LayeredNeuralNetwork`
   - `AttentionLayer`, `MultiHeadAttentionLayer`
   - All layer types that have parameters

2. **Add `parameters` and `gradients` properties to Gaussian processes**
   - `GP` class for hyperparameter optimization
   - Kernel parameter optimization

3. **Ensure consistent interface across all models**
   - All models should have `parameters` and `gradients` properties
   - All models should have `objective()` method for optimization

### Phase 2: Create Optimization Module
4. **Implement `optimisation.py` with modern algorithms**
   - **SGD**: Stochastic Gradient Descent with momentum
   - **Adam**: Adaptive Moment Estimation
   - **RMSprop**: Root Mean Square Propagation
   - **Adagrad**: Adaptive Gradient Algorithm
   - **AdamW**: Adam with weight decay
   - **LBFGS**: Limited-memory BFGS (for small problems)

5. **Create unified optimizer interface**
   - `Optimizer` base class
   - `SGD`, `Adam`, `RMSprop`, etc. as concrete implementations
   - Learning rate scheduling
   - Early stopping
   - Gradient clipping

### Phase 3: Integration and Testing
6. **Update all models to use unified interface**
   - Remove model-specific optimization code
   - Use centralized optimizers
   - Maintain backward compatibility

7. **Comprehensive testing**
   - Test all optimizers with all model types
   - Compare optimization performance
   - Validate gradient computations

## Implementation Plan

## Backward Compatibility
This implementation will maintain full backward compatibility:
- All existing model interfaces remain unchanged
- Existing training methods continue to work
- New optimization interface is additive
- Gradual migration path for existing code

## Testing Strategy
1. **Gradient Consistency Tests**: All models with finite differences
2. **Optimization Performance Tests**: Compare different optimizers
3. **Integration Tests**: Test optimizers with all model types
4. **Regression Tests**: Ensure no performance degradation
5. **Benchmark Tests**: Compare with existing implementations

## Benefits

- **Better Performance**: Improved convergence and training stability
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new optimization algorithms
- **Code Reuse**: Eliminate duplication across models
- **Research Ready**: Enable advanced ML research workflows

## Risks and Mitigation
- **Risk**: Breaking existing training code
  - **Mitigation**: Maintain backward compatibility, gradual migration
- **Risk**: Performance regression

- **Risk**: Complex gradient computation
  - **Mitigation**: Thorough testing, finite difference validation

## Success Criteria
