# CIP-XXXX: [Title]

> **Note**: CIPs describe HOW to achieve requirements (WHAT).  
> Use `related_requirements` to link to the requirements this CIP implements.

> **Compression Metadata**: The `compressed` field tracks whether this CIP's key decisions have been compressed into formal documentation (README, Sphinx, architecture docs). Set to `false` by default. After closing a CIP and updating formal documentation with its essential outcomes, set `compressed: true`. This enables `whats-next` to prompt for documentation compression. See [REQ-000E](../../requirements/req000E_documentation-synchronization.md) and [CIP-0013](../../cip/cip0013.md).

## Status

- [ ] Proposed - Initial idea documented
- [ ] Accepted - Approved, ready to start work
- [ ] In Progress - Actively being implemented
- [ ] Implemented - Work complete, awaiting verification
- [ ] Closed - Verified and complete
- [ ] Rejected - Will not be implemented (add reason, use superseded_by if replaced)
- [ ] Deferred - Postponed (use blocked_by field to indicate blocker)

## Summary
A brief summary of the proposed improvement.

**Which requirements does this CIP address?** List them in `related_requirements` above.

## Motivation
Why is this change needed? What problem does it solve?

## Detailed Description
More detailed explanation of the proposed improvement, including technical details.

> **Important**: CIPs should be self-contained design documents (REQ-000D).  
> Include all design rationale, architecture decisions, and technical analysis HERE in this section.  
> Don't create separate design documents like `cip0012-design.md` or `cip0012-architecture.md`.  
> If you need supplementary materials (research notes, alternatives), use a subdirectory: `cip/cip0012/`

## Implementation Plan
Step-by-step plan for implementing the improvement:

1. **Step 1**:
   - Sub-task 1
   - Sub-task 2

2. **Step 2**:
   - Sub-task 1
   - Sub-task 2
