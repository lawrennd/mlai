# CIP-0005: Simple Attention Implementation for Educational Purposes

## Summary
Add a simple attention mechanism to the mlai library to support educational material on chain rule computation in transformers. Focus on clear, pedagogical implementation that demonstrates the mathematical principles rather than production-ready transformer architecture.

## Motivation
The transformer educational snippets (`chain-rule-transformer-attention.md` and `simple-transformer-implementation.md`) need a simple attention implementation to demonstrate the chain rule principles. The current CIP is too complex and production-oriented for the educational context. Students need to understand the mathematical flow of gradients through attention, not build production transformers.

## Detailed Description
The educational material focuses on understanding how gradients flow through the attention mechanism, specifically the "three-path chain rule" where the same input matrix appears in Query, Key, and Value transformations. The implementation should be simple and clear to illustrate these mathematical principles.

### Required Classes:

1. *Attention*: Basic scaled dot-product attention with clear forward/backward passes
2. *MultiHeadAttention*: Simple wrapper that uses multiple Attention instances
3. *PositionalEncoding*: Basic sinusoidal encoding for sequence understanding

### Key Features:
- Clear forward pass showing Q, K, V transformations
- Explicit backward pass demonstrating chain rule computation
- Simple implementation without complex optimizations
- Focus on mathematical understanding over performance
- Minimal dependencies and clear code structure

## Implementation Plan
Step-by-step plan for implementing the educational attention components:

1. **Basic Attention Mechanism**:
   - Implement `Attention` class with clear forward pass showing Q, K, V transformations
   - Add explicit backward pass demonstrating the three-path chain rule
   - Focus on mathematical clarity over optimization
   - Include clear documentation of gradient flow

2. **Multi-Head Attention**:
   - Implement `MultiHeadAttention` as simple wrapper around multiple `Attention` instances
   - Show how gradients accumulate across heads
   - Keep implementation simple and educational

3. **Positional Encoding**:
   - Implement basic `PositionalEncoding` with sinusoidal functions
   - Focus on understanding rather than optimization
   - Clear mathematical formulation

4. **Educational Testing**:
   - Create tests that validate gradient computations
   - Add examples showing chain rule in action
   - Test with simple synthetic data
   - Focus on mathematical correctness over performance

## Backward Compatibility
This change adds new classes to the mlai library without modifying existing functionality. All new classes will be in a new `transformer` module to avoid conflicts with existing neural network implementations.

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests focusing on gradient computation correctness
- Tests with simple synthetic data to validate chain rule
- Mathematical validation of attention weight computation
- Educational examples showing gradient flow
- Simple integration tests with basic transformer components

## Related Requirements
This CIP addresses the following educational requirements:

- Support for chain rule demonstration in transformer attention
- Simple attention mechanism for educational purposes
- Clear implementation showing Q, K, V transformations
- Demonstration of three-path chain rule computation

Specifically, it implements solutions for:
- Basic attention mechanism with clear mathematical formulation
- Multi-head attention as simple composition of basic attention
- Positional encoding for sequence understanding
- Educational examples showing gradient flow through attention
