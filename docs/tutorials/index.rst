Getting Started
--------------

If you're new to MLAI, we recommend starting with the :doc:`../quickstart` guide before diving into these tutorials.

Each tutorial is designed to be educational and includes:

- Clear explanations of the underlying concepts
- Step-by-step code examples
- Mathematical background where relevant
- Visualizations to aid understanding
