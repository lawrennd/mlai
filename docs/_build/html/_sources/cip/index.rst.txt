What are CIPs?
--------------

CIPs (Code Improvement Proposals) are documents that describe proposed changes to the MLAI codebase. They serve as:

- Documentation for design decisions and architectural changes
- Project management tools to track implementation progress
- Communication mechanisms for sharing ideas with collaborators
- Historical records of why and how code evolved over time

CIP Process
-----------

1. **Create**: New CIPs are created using the template in the `cip/` directory
2. **Review**: CIPs are shared and reviewed by the community
3. **Implementation**: Once accepted, implementation begins with progress tracking
4. **Completion**: CIPs are marked as completed when implementation is finished

Current Status
--------------

- **CIP-0001**: Documentation Improvements with Sphinx (Proposed)
- **CIP-0002**: Comprehensive Test Framework with pytest (Proposed)

For more information about the CIP process, see the `CIP README <../cip/README.md>`_.
