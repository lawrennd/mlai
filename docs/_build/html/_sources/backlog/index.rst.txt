Project Backlog
===============

This section provides an overview of the project backlog - tasks and improvements that are planned but not yet implemented.

What is the Backlog?
--------------------

The backlog is a structured approach to tracking tasks, issues, and improvements that need to be implemented in the MLAI project. It serves as:

- Task management for organizing and prioritizing work items
- Documentation of planned features and improvements
- Project planning tool for coordinating work across the team
- Historical record of completed and abandoned tasks

Backlog Structure
-----------------

The backlog is organized into different categories:

- *Documentation*: Documentation-related tasks
- *Infrastructure*: Infrastructure-related tasks  
- *Features*: Feature-related tasks
- *Bugs*: Bug-related tasks

Task Status Workflow
--------------------

Tasks follow this workflow:

1. *Proposed*: Initial idea or concept
2. *Ready*: Fully described and ready for implementation
3. *In Progress*: Currently being worked on
4. *Completed*: Successfully implemented
5. *Abandoned*: Will not be implemented (with explanation)

Current Backlog
---------------

The backlog is maintained in the `backlog/` directory. For the most up-to-date information, see the `backlog README <../backlog/README.md>`_.

Integration with CIPs
--------------------

Backlog items can be linked to CIPs when they represent significant improvements or architectural changes. This provides traceability between high-level design decisions and specific implementation tasks.

For more information about the backlog system, see the `backlog README <../backlog/README.md>`_.
