# What's Next Script

## Overview

The "What's Next" script is a project status summarizer that helps LLMs and human users quickly understand the current state of the VibeSafe project and identify pending tasks. It provides a comprehensive overview of:

- Git repository status
- CIP (Code Improvement Proposal) status
- Backlog item status
- Recommended next steps
- Files needing YAML frontmatter

## Installation

The script is located in the `scripts` directory of the VibeSafe repository:

```bash
scripts/whats_next.py
```

### Dependencies

The script requires:
- Python 3.6+
- PyYAML library

You can install everything needed using:

1. The installation script (recommended):
   ```bash
   # This creates a virtual environment and sets up a convenient wrapper
   ./install-whats-next.sh
   ```

2. Using the run-python-tests.sh script (for development):
   ```bash
   # This creates a virtual environment for testing
   ./scripts/run-python-tests.sh
   ```

3. Using the pyproject.toml file (if you have Poetry installed):
   ```bash
   # Install Poetry if you don't have it
   curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
   
   # Install dependencies
   poetry install
   ```

## Usage

After installation using the installation script, run the script using:

```bash
./whats-next
```

If you prefer to run it directly, make sure to activate the virtual environment first:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python scripts/whats_next.py
deactivate  # When finished
```

### Command Line Options

The script supports several command line options:

- `--no-git`: Skip Git status information
- `--no-color`: Disable colored output
- `--cip-only`: Only show CIP information
- `--backlog-only`: Only show backlog information
- `--quiet`: Suppress all output except next steps

Examples:

```bash
# Show only the next steps (useful for quick reference)
./whats-next --quiet

# Focus only on CIPs
./whats-next --cip-only

# Focus only on backlog items
./whats-next --backlog-only

# Disable color (useful for non-interactive terminals)
./whats-next --no-color
```

## Output Sections

### Git Status

Shows the current branch, recent commits, modified files, and untracked files.

### CIP Status

Lists all CIPs, categorized by their status (proposed, accepted, implemented, closed), and identifies those missing YAML frontmatter.

### Backlog Status

Lists backlog items, highlighting high-priority items and those in progress, and identifies items missing YAML frontmatter.

### Recommended Next Steps

Provides a prioritized list of recommended actions based on the project's current state.

### Files Needing YAML Frontmatter

Lists specific files that need YAML frontmatter to be added for better project tracking.

## YAML Frontmatter

The script checks for and recommends adding YAML frontmatter to CIPs and backlog items. See [YAML Frontmatter Examples](yaml_frontmatter_examples.md) for the required format.

## For Developers

### Testing

The script includes unit tests to ensure its functionality. To run the tests:

```bash
# Run all tests (creates a virtual environment automatically)
./scripts/run-python-tests.sh

# Alternatively, run tests manually
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pytest tests/
deactivate
```

```

### Extending the Script

The script is designed to be modular and extensible. If you want to add new functionality:

1. Add new functions in `scripts/whats_next.py`
2. Update the `generate_next_steps` function to include your new functionality
3. Add tests for your changes in `tests/test_whats_next.py`
4. Update this documentation as needed

## For LLMs

This script is particularly useful for LLMs working on the VibeSafe project, as it provides quick context about the project's current state and priorities. 

When an LLM is asked to work on VibeSafe, it should:

1. Run the "What's Next" script to get current project status
2. Review the recommended next steps
3. Understand the high-priority items
4. Check if there are files missing YAML frontmatter that need updating

This approach ensures that LLMs have the necessary context to make informed decisions about what tasks to prioritize.
